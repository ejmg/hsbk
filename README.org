/[a work in progress!]/

This repository contains the notes and solutions I've written up so far as I
work through [[haskellbook.com][Haskell Programming from First Principles]] by Christopher Allen and
Julie Moronuki.

This effort is largely made possible by my directed readings course for spring
2019, overseen by Dr. Song at UMKC.

** Status

Currently, the logic and organization of this repository is limited mostly to
keeping exercises and notes under the proper chapter of the book. There are
often lots of comments in each source file for my thinking for a given
solution.

I hope to later reformat my work into Org-mode files for literate
programming as a means to narrate (to myself and the readers) my thinking
towards a problem and or a given topic.
